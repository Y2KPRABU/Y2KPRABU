    <br/><br/>
<p>This Gmail widget helps the gmail users to select an email and create an event in your Google calendar from the Email Subject and Body, 
  through the Add on screen, without leaving the Gmail window.
  <br/><br/>
  <h2 How to use it</h2>
    Click the Orange calendar icon in the right panel of your Gmail
      <img src="Homepage.png" alt="Home Page on Add on Selection" width="500" height="600"></img>
    Select any email in the email panel on the left
    you will see that the add-on view refreshes with the Subject of the email title
    It also shows a DateTime picker for Event start date and Event End date.
    Select the Appropriate Date and Time of the Event
    Click on Convert to Event.
    thats it .. within 2 seconds, the event is created in your calendar now, without leaving the Gmail window.
    Hope you love this add on.
    thanks
